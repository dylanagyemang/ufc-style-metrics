# UFC Style Metrics
Data-driven study of UFC fighting styles, win ratios, and champion conversion rates (Compared with ESPN champion data.)

This project is a data-driven analysis of UFC fighter styles and championship outcomes, built to showcase analytical, data visualization, and dashboarding skills. Using a custom dataset of UFC fighters alongside ESPN’s champion records, the study explores style representation, overall win ratios, and champion conversion rates. An interactive Streamlit dashboard provides side-by-side comparisons between the dataset and ESPN’s records, highlighting where narratives diverge and which fighting styles are most efficient at producing champions.

The repository includes:

Raw data (UFC fighter dataset + ESPN champion data)

Python analysis & Streamlit app for interactive exploration

Charts and tables showing style representation, win ratios, conversion rates, and cross-source champion comparisons

This project demonstrates practical skills in data wrangling, statistical analysis, visualization, and deployment of interactive dashboards.
